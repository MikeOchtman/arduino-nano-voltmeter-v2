# arduino-nano-voltmeter-v2
A quick, easy sketch for an arduino-nano-based voltmeter with OLED I2C u8g2 128x32 

If I need a quick voltmeter for monitoring projects, I'll often quickly recreate this simple sketch on the breadboard so I have a constant view of a point of interest. It's not fast, it's not terribly accurate, it doesn't have great input impedence, but it serves every purpose I need it for.
